Terminal IDE uses the command line with many native C apps. There are DEFINITELY 
more apps that some of you might want.\n
\n
You can of course add C applications you have compiled yourself to Terminal IDE. 
Just put them in the ~/local/bin folder.. like your Java / Shell scripts. \n
\n
Yes GCC 4.4.0 is available in Terminal IDE, but I have yet to get a ./configure, make, make install to work.. 
They build, but they seg fault.. :-( Your own projects should be fine, but the 
libc / bionic differences need to be fixed as you go, as all in one go, never seems to work.\n
\n
The Android NDK has come a long way, and you can now create stand alone toolchains. Most of the apps in Terminal IDE are compiled with CodeSourcery, statically linked.\n
\n
For a really good start - use http://dan.drown.org/android/\n
\n
You still have to fix up any issues that arise, but his build scripts work really well! Thanks DAN!\n
\n
I'm not going to go into too much depth, as this is something you will have to wrestle with yourself, as we all do :-)!\n
