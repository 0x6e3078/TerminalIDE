"We will now compile a complete command line java application, that uses the library we compiled in Tutorial 3.\n
\n
cd into the home folder\n
\n
# cd ~/system/src/demo_console/\n
\n
Check things out..\n
\n
# cat ./builder.sh\n
# cat ./run.sh\n
\n
Notice how the lib file has been integrated into the build commands.\n
\n
Also, check out the terminalide.vim file\n
\n
# cat ./terminalide.vim\n
\n
Just take a look at it. It will make sense later.\n
\n
Now run terminalide\n
\n
# terminalide\n
\n
Open the start.java file in the src dir.\n
\n
Compile with [F7]..\n
\n
There are ERRORS! This is normal.\n
\n
Also, the java-complete functions will not work for libfunc.\n
\n
This is because the vim variables have not been told about the new build environment and added libs.\n
\n
Run this function in vim. Make sure you are in the main window and in Control mode.\n
\n
:source ../terminalide.vim\n
\n
This will set the variables up correctly for the window so that java-complete and javac now work.\n
\n
Now try and compile. It should work fine. And the java completion for libfunc aswell..\n
\n
Use the builder script to create the full app.\n
\n
:! ../builder.sh\n
\n
Now lets open a second file.\n
\n
Move to NERDTree\n
\n
[ESC][CTRL]+W LEFT\n
\n
Open up name.java aswell. You will now notice a thin window appear at the top 
with the names of your current buffers. Also name.java will now be visible in the main window\n
\n
Move into this MiniBufExpl window, [CTRL]+W UP\n
\n
Press TAB or SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the windows, and ENTER to select one. Nice.\n
\n
There are other nice ways to switch buffers.\n
\n
:buffers\n
\n
this shows a list of buffers, and you then choose with\n
\n
:buffer [number]\n
\n
I have created a simple mapping in ~/.vimrc so just press [F5].. \n
\n
Play around here and then go to tutorial 5.
