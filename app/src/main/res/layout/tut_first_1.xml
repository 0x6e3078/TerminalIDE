"Follow all these tutorials through EXACTLY.\n
\n
They will help you compile the sample applications in ~/system/src step by step.\n
\n
The best way to follow these tutorials is by logging in over telnet/ssh and then
you can read and follow on the device, whilst using the computer to perform the actions.\n
\n
Let's Begin..\n
\n
Installing the basic system.\n
\n
Click \'Install System\' on the main page, and then follow the instructions.\n
\n
Make sure you have enabled the Terminal IDE Keyboard in Settings > Langauge and Keyboard
on your device. Then choose the Terminal IDE keyboard - click \'Keyboard\' on the main page.\n
\n
Start Terminal IDE. Click the button..\n
\n
You will now be presented with a nice not-short color prompt. You can change this by typing, \n
\n
..$ export PS1=#\n
\n
But it does look really nice over telnet/ssh.. :-p\n
\n
   - Double-tap toggles the keyboard.\n
   - Swipe left and right to view your 4 Terminals.\n
   - Long pressing the screen brings up the Terminal Chooser menu.\n
   - Press \'Menu\' for Options\n
\n
----------------------------------------------\n
[This part is optional but highly recommended]\n
\n
Run telnetd. No parameters are rquired. Defaults setup in ~/.bashrc.You 
can see what is actually being run by typing :\n
\n
# cat `which telnetd`\n
\n
Anyway - start telnetd with :\n
\n
# telnetd
\n
You should now see telnetd startup info. Ending in ../system/bin/bash\n
\n
You can shut telnetd down at any stage by typing [CTRL]-C on the Terminal IDE Keyboard\n
\n
Now, go to your nice big computer and login via telnet. I have set the escape character to blank, as it is the same as the vim help link follow key.\n
\n
[Either]\n
$ telnet -e '' [THE PHONES IP] 8080\n
\n
[Or - better still with adb, which is part of the Android SDK]\n
Plug your phone into computer via USB first, then\n
\n
$ adb -d forward tcp:8080 tcp 8080\n
$ telnet -e '' 127.0.01 8080\n
\n
['' is 2 single quotes not a double quote]\n
\n
Now you should be connected to the system via TELNET!\n
\n
[And you can connect multiple times simultaneously]\n
------------------------------------------------\n
\n
OK - let's start programming.\n
