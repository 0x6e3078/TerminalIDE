Terminal IDE comes with a complete Java / Android development kit, and has a very powerful and java optimised editor - vim.\n
\n
A set of sample applications can be found in ~/system/src. I strongly recommend
you read the \'Tutorial\' help through to the end. It will show you what you
need to know.\n
\n
vim has been specifically configured for java!\n
\n
Know that these features are supported :-\n
     -Full syntax highlighting - of numerous languages\n
     -Auto popup completion of files, words and syntax of numerous languages\n
     -Java-Completion - in vim insert mode , CTRL-X CTRL-U\n
     -One button Compile [F7] - check ~/.vimrc\n
     -List of errors on compilation and ability to jump through them [F8][[F9]\n
     -Left pane file-browser - the vim NERDTree plugin\n
     -Lots more..\n
\n
Compiling for Android is a little different, as after the normal javac compile, classes
need to be converted to the \'dex\' format Android\'s dalvikVM requires.\n
\n
Also - \'aapt\' and \'apkbuilder\' are required to build the resources and final .apk file.\n
\n
All of this is provided..\n
\n
Android has a Java VM but it is called Dalvik. It needs to be called in a special way
to enable you to run java applications from the command line. (Especially as a non-root user!)
All this has been fixed and now works. Voila.\n
\n
Review the build scripts used in the
samples to see how all the different apps are pieced together.\n
